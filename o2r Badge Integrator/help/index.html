        <h3>Full size badges</h3>
        <p>The badges for licencing information consist of three information parts.
            Information about the code-licence, the data-licence and the text-licence are included in the badge.
            The code licences of research compendia are compared to the list of <a href="http://licenses.opendefinition.org/licenses/groups/osi.json">OSI-comliant</a> licences.
            If the licence is part of this list, the code category gets a green tick and is, therefore, open. If the licence is not included in the
            list of OSI-compliant licences, it is marked with a red cross as closed. For no included metadata on the code licence, a grey questionmark is used
            for the representation of no available information on licencing information.
            Data-and text-licences are both compared to the list of <a href="http://licenses.opendefinition.org/licenses/groups/od.json">OD-compliant</a> licences.
            The procedure of getting a category for the badge is the same as with the code-licence. The levels are open, closed and no information available.
            The whole badge is categorised afterwards with the wigted information of these three licences. If every licene is open, the compendium retrieves a green badge,
            if two of three are open, it retrieves a yellow badge. Orange badges represent partially open compendia, with one of three licences open. A red badge signals
            every single category with non open-source licences. If no information is available for all categories, the badge is grey.
        </p>
        <h3>Shields IO badges License</h3>
        <p>These are small representations of the full-size badges. They are used to give a brief overview on the licencing information.
            The same colour-scheme is used as with the full-size badges.

        <h3>Shields IO badges Peer Review</h3>
        <p>For the the peer review status, there are no full-sized badge and the information is included in Shields.IO badges. Moreover, there are no set number of return badges since the DOI is passed to the DOAJ API and can receive numerous results regarding the peer-reviewed status of a research. Nonetheless, 4 possible examples are shown here. The API DOAJ contains peer-reviewed only, therefore if a research title matches it will return the "Peer Review - YES" green badge. Likewise, if the research is not found it will return the "Peer Review - NO" red badge. Unknown shall be returned for researches hosted on DOAJ that do not have peer review information associated with them. Lastly, the "Peer Review - Blind" badge, is returned for researches in which the names of reviewers are hidden from the author. Either single Blind review or double blind review is considered, as explained <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review">here.</a>

        <h3>Full size badge</h3>
        <p>The full size badges display the information for executability with visual information. For the positive badge, a green background is used
            and a tick is shown. For no executability the badge is red and displays a cross. Still running compendia show an hourglass on yellow background.
            If no information is available, the badge is grey and shows a questionmark.
        </p>
        <h3>Shields IO badges Executability</h3>
        <p>For the executable status, there are also no full-sized badge and the information is included in Shields.IO badges.
            After the request from a client with an doi was done, the corresponding o2r id is matched to it.
            If the code in a compendium is executable, the status is "success" the green badge is sent to the client. The yellow badge
            is used for compendia, which have a running code, but the execution of the code isn't finished yet, the status then is "running.
            For a "fail" the red badge is sent if no information are available, the grey badge is sent.

        <h3>Shields IO badges Release Time</h3>
        <p>For the release time status, there are no full-sized badges since the release time information is included in Shields.IO badges.
            Two possible examples are shown here. The badge shows the release year of a paper and in case that there is no
            release year given, the n/a badge is returned.

        <h3>Shields IO badges Spatial Information</h3>
        <p> The spatial information badge gives information about the research location, that means where a research was done.
            For receiving the spatial information reverse geocoding with the <a href="http://geonames.org">geonames.org</a> api is used. The base for running this
            is a JSON file that contains two coordinate pairs representing a bounding box which contains the research location. As the api only accepts coordinate
            pairs, the mean center from the bounding box is calculated. These coordinates are send to the api which responds with the country name and if available also
            a district/region, which are the information that are shown in the shields.io badge.

        <h3>Map Visualization</h3>
        <p>The spatial badge, provides a map view of the bounding box displayed on a <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet map</a>. The map centers its view to the center of the research location.
            The map can be draged and zoomed interactively. Clicking on this map displays the attribution and copyright of the leaflet and <a href="http://osm.org">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors.
